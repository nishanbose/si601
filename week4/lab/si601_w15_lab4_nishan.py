# Lab 4 (20 points): SQL queries for adding and retrieving database records
# Based on an earlier problem created by Dr. Yuhang Wang, and later modified by
# Prof. Kevyn Collins-Thompson

# In this lab you will add the appropriate SQL queries at the marked points
# in this code framework to obtain output that matches the sample desired output.
# There are two XML input files: customer.xml and nation.xml.
# You will first read these files using the provided read_xml_file function
# and create the tables in the database using SQL commands.
# You will then perform various kinds of retrieval operations with SQL on
# the tables you created.
